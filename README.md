10. Problem Statement: Radiometric Thermal UAV Imagery for Wildfire Management

Introduction:

Wildfires are increasingly becoming a global concern, causing widespread environmental damage, loss of life, and economic loss. Traditional wildfire monitoring techniques, such as satellite imaging and ground-based observations, often fail to provide real-time data or are hindered by weather conditions. With the rise of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, equipped with radiometric thermal sensors, it is now possible to monitor wildfires in real-time with high precision. Thermal UAV imagery offers the capability to detect hotspots, map fire perimeters, and evaluate fire intensity, enabling faster and more effective wildfire management strategies.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to leverage radiometric thermal UAV imagery to provide real-time monitoring and analysis of wildfires. This will enhance the capabilities of wildfire management teams to detect active fire regions, monitor fire spread, and assess damage, ultimately improving decision-making during wildfire emergencies. The goal is to integrate thermal imaging data with machine learning algorithms to automatically detect hotspots and predict fire behavior, allowing for more efficient resource allocation and quicker response times.

Key Features:

Real-Time Monitoring: Use of UAVs with thermal sensors to capture live data of wildfire areas, enabling near-instant analysis.

Fire Hotspot Detection: Thermal imagery to identify active hotspots, enabling quick response from firefighting teams.

Fire Intensity Mapping: Radiometric thermal sensors to assess the intensity and heat of fire regions, providing valuable data for resource allocation.

Geospatial Mapping: Integration of UAV data with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for mapping fire perimeters, assessing burn areas, and identifying escape routes.

Predictive Analytics: Machine learning algorithms applied to predict fire behavior based on thermal data, wind direction, and topographical features.

Cost-Effective: Drones are more cost-effective than manned aircraft and satellite systems while providing more granular data,

Implementation:

The project will involve deploying UAVs equipped with radiometric thermal cameras over wildfire-prone areas to collect real-time data during wildfire events. The following steps will be implemented:
1. Data Collection: UAVs will fly over fire-prone areas to capture high-resolution thermal imagery, detecting temperature variations indicative of active fires.

2. Data Preprocessing: The thermal imagery will be processed to filter out noise and enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for more accurate hotspot detection.

3. Machine Learning: Deep learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)) will be trained to automatically detect fire hotspots and classify fire intensity from the thermal images.

4. Geospatial Integration: Thermal images will be combined with GIS data to generate real-time fire perimeter maps, identifying high-risk areas and escape routes.

5. Predictive Model: A predictive model will be developed to forecast fire behavior based on current thermal imagery and other environmental factors like wind speed and humidity.

6. Data visualization: Transform datasets and results into intuitive and interactive visual formats, enhancing insights and decision-making

Technical Approach:

Data Collection Tools: Use of UAVs equipped with radiometric thermal cameras to capture real-time temperature readings from the wildfire.

Machine Learning Models: Utilize CNNs for feature extraction and classification of thermal images, detecting fire hotspots and fireline progression.

Geospatial Analysis: Integration with GIS software for geospatial mapping of fire perimeters, affected regions, and logistical planning.

Predictive Analytics: Build machine learning models to predict the behavior of the fire (e.g., spread, direction) based on environmental variables, historical data, and thermal imaging.

Deployment: UAVs will be deployed in areas susceptible to wildfires to ensure rapid response during active fire events, with data transmitted to the central control system for processing.

Benefits:

Faster Response Time: Real-time thermal data allows fire management teams to assess the situation quickly, reducing response times and potentially saving lives and property.

Accurate Hotspot Detection: Thermal imagery allows precise identification of fire hotspots, enabling targeted firefighting efforts.

Cost Efficiency: UAVs provide a more affordable solution for wildfire monitoring compared to manned aircraft or satellite imagery.
LONE

Improved Decision-Making: With real-time data and predictive analytics, fire management teams can make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and evacuation plans.

ANE

Post-Fire Assessment: Thermal UAV imagery can also be used to assess the extent of fire damage and help in post-event analysis for recovery and mitigation planning.

### *1. Data Collection*

- *UAV Platform:* Use drones like DJI M30T or Autel Robotics XT709 equipped with radiometric thermal cameras.
- *Data Types:* Collect synchronized RGB and thermal images (e.g., TIFFs with per-pixel temperature values), georeferenced using ground control points (GCPs)[1][7].
- *Acquisition Frequency:* Capture images every 3â€“5 seconds to monitor fire progression in near real-time[1][7].

---

### *2. Data Preprocessing*

- *Noise Filtering:* Apply image denoising and normalization to thermal images.
- *Alignment:* Register and orthorectify images using GCPs for accurate geospatial mapping[1][7].
- *Temperature Calibration:* Convert raw thermal data to actual temperature maps.

---

### *3. Hotspot Detection and Fire Intensity Mapping*

- *Model:* Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for fire segmentation and intensity classification using labeled datasets (e.g., FLAME 3)[1][3][7].
- *Input:* Radiometric thermal images (per-pixel temperature).
- *Output:* Binary mask for fire/no-fire, intensity map (e.g., low/medium/high).

*Sample Code for CNN-based Hotspot Detection:*

python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Simple CNN for fire detection
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')  # Fire/No Fire
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# Train with preprocessed thermal images and labels
# model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

Adapt input shape and output classes as needed for intensity mapping (multi-class classification)[3][4].

from shapely.geometry import Polygon

# Example: Convert fire mask to polygons (pseudo-code)
# fire_mask: binary numpy array from CNN output
# polygons = mask_to_polygons(fire_mask)
# gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': polygons})
# gdf.to_file('fire_perimeter.shp')
