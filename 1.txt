## Problem Statement

Wildfires are becoming increasingly devastating globally, causing:
- Environmental destruction
- Loss of life
- Economic damage exceeding billions annually

**Traditional monitoring methods are insufficient:**
- Satellite imagery lacks resolution and real-time capability

- Manned aircraft are costly and cannot safely access all areas

**Our Solution:** Leveraging UAV-mounted radiometric thermal cameras with deep learning to enable:
- Real-time wildfire detection and monitoring

## The FLAME 3 Dataset

Our approach utilizes the FLAME 3 Computer Vision Subset (Sycan Marsh) dataset which contains:
- Thermal imagery captured by UAVs over wildfire-affected areas
- Multiple classes representing different fire conditions and intensities
- Radiometric data that provides temperature information

2. **Transfer learning with CNN architecture**
3. **Hotspot detection algorithm**
4. **Fire intensity mapping**
5. **Geospatial integration**
6. **Predictive modeling for fire spread**

## 1. Data Preprocessing & Augmentation

Thermal imagery presents unique challenges requiring specialized preprocessing:

**Challenges:**
- Limited training data availability
- Thermal image characteristics differ from natural images
- Temperature calibration across different sensors
- Environmental factors affecting thermal readings

**Our approach:**
- Implemented custom normalization for thermal imagery
- Applied domain-specific data augmentation:
  - Horizontal/vertical flips
  - Random rotations
  - Brightness/contrast adjustments calibrated for thermal imagery
  - Thermal noise simulation

**Example of our augmentation pipeline:**

```python
train_transform = A.Compose([
    A.Resize(224, 224),
    A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    A.VerticalFlip(p=0.5),
    A.RandomRotate90(p=0.5),
    A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.3),
    A.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
    ToTensorV2()
])
```

## 2. Transfer Learning with CNN Architecture

Our model architecture leverages transfer learning with a specialized approach for thermal imagery:

**Why ResNet50?**
- Pre-trained on millions of images to recognize fundamental visual patterns
- Deep architecture allowing for complex feature extraction
- Skip connections mitigate vanishing gradient problems
- Well-suited for real-time deployment on edge devices

**Our adaptations for thermal imagery:**
- Customized final classification layers for wildfire-specific features
- Fine-tuned feature extraction layers for thermal data characteristics
- Implemented class-balanced loss function to handle imbalanced wildfire data

```python
def create_model(num_classes):
    # Load pretrained model
    model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
    
    # Freeze all layers
    for param in model.parameters():
        param.requires_grad = False
    
    # Replace the final fully connected layer
    num_features = model.fc.in_features
    model.fc = nn.Sequential(
        nn.Linear(num_features, 256),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.Dropout(0.5),
        nn.Linear(256, num_classes)
    )
    
    return model
```

## 3. Hotspot Detection Algorithm

We developed a specialized algorithm for thermal hotspot detection:

**Detection process:**
1. Initial classification of image regions using our CNN model
2. Temperature thresholding to identify potential hotspots
3. Contour detection to determine hotspot boundaries
4. Filtering based on size and intensity to reduce false positives

**Example hotspot detection result:**

![Hotspot Detection Example](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300)

**Implementation highlights:**

```python
def detect_hotspots(image_path, model, threshold=0.7):
    # Load and preprocess image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    img_gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Apply threshold to identify hotspots
    _, thresh = cv2.threshold(img_gray, 200, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
    
    # Find contours of hotspots
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, 
                                 cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    # Process and classify hotspots
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        # Model prediction code
        pass
        
    return fire_class, confidence, num_hotspots
```

## 4. Fire Intensity Mapping

Our system creates detailed fire intensity maps from thermal data:

**Analytical approach:**
- Radiometric calibration to convert pixel values to temperature
- Intensity classification based on temperature thresholds
- Spatial clustering to identify high-risk areas
- Temporal comparison to track intensity changes

**Example fire intensity map:**

## 5. Geospatial Integration

We integrated our analysis with GIS capabilities:

**Key geospatial features:**
- GPS tagging of all thermal imagery
- Real-time fire perimeter mapping
- Integration with topographical data
- Identification of critical infrastructure in proximity
- Escape route calculation

**Example of our geospatial visualization:**

![Geospatial Mapping](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400)

```python
def simulate_geospatial_mapping(num_points=10):
    # Generate coordinates and intensity data
    lat = np.random.uniform(42.0, 42.1, num_points)
    lon = np.random.uniform(-121.5, -121.4, num_points)
    intensity = np.random.uniform(0, 1, num_points)
    
    # Create visualization
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    plt.scatter(lon, lat, c=intensity, cmap='hot_r', s=100, alpha=0.7)
    plt.colorbar(label='Fire Intensity')
    
    # Simulate fire perimeter
    # Additional code to plot fire perimeter
    
    return map_data
```

## 6. Predictive Modeling for Fire Spread

We implemented a predictive model for fire spread:

**Factors incorporated:**
- Current fire intensity from thermal data
- Wind speed and direction
- Topographical features
- Fuel type and moisture content
- Historical fire behavior

**Example prediction visualization:**

![Fire Spread Prediction](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400)

```python
def predict_fire_spread(image_path, wind_direction=45, wind_speed=15):
    # Process image to identify current fire state
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    img_gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Calculate center of mass of hotspots
    moments = cv2.moments(thresh)
    cx = int(moments["m10"] / moments["m00"])
    cy = int(moments["m01"] / moments["m00"])
    
    # Calculate spread direction based on wind
    wind_rad = np.radians(wind_direction)
    dx = wind_speed * np.cos(wind_rad)
    dy = wind_speed * np.sin(wind_rad)
    
    # Visualize prediction
    # Visualization code here
    
    return spread_prediction
```
